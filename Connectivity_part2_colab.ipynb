        "Our conceptualization is based on the following rationale:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Synchronous connectivity** results from rapid and simultaneous hydrological response, where the timing and shape of the runoff response are consistent across multiple locations. Hence,  flumes that are close in space (i.e. in adjacent sub-watersheds), but not necessarily located upslope/downslope can be activated simultaneously. For this reason, the inverse Euclidean distance is an appropriate feature to be used in deriving the $SC_{sync}$ network, because it draws stronger links between flumes that lie in closer proximity to one another. In addition, because of the way that hydrological processes scale with watershed area,  we can expect a more similar hydrological response for flumes that have similar contributing areas. Therefore, weights describing the similarity of the channels with respect to the size of their contributing areas can be added as an additional feature in the $SC_{sync}$ in order to in order to characterise the overall possibility space in which $FC_{sync}$ can occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Sequential connectivity** on the other hand, represents the processed-based connectivity of water flowing through the river network, and depends on the opportunity time for water to infiltrate into the channel bed. Thus, the length of the channel as well as the average channel slope between two flumes are two key structural features that affect how the water flows through this type of ephemeral system. Shorter channel lengths and steeper slopes contribute to stronger structural connections between the flumes.\n",
